# <a href="https://github.com/mapbox">Mapbox<a>
<p> Mapbox is an online provider of maps and map API's. We used it to create an interactive map API where the user could see available listings.</p>
<p> Using Mapbox we were able to locate and display available storage locations for the user using map markers. </p>


# <a href="https://github.com/excid3/noticed">Noticed<a>
<p> Noticed was used to send notifications to Hosts whenever someone requested to rent out their listing</p>
<p> With Noticed, we were able to send notifications to the database in order to properly display them </p>

# <a href="https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder">Geocoder<a>
 <p> Geococder is a Gem that allowed us to easily convert user/host addresses into accurate longitude and latitude coordinates.</p>
 <p> This allowed us to easily verify for valid user/host addresses, correct display of locations in Map, and calculation of distances between points.</p>
